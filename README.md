# Sample Website

This is a sample website made as part of [*LearnEnough Git to be Dangerous*](http://learnenoug.com/git-tutorial), claiming to possibly be the greatest beginner Git tutorial in the history of the universe. Michael Hartl (its creator (of the tutorial, not the universe silly)) wants you to [check it out](http://learnenough.com/git-tutorial), and be sure to [join the email list](http://learnough.com/#email_list).

After finishing *Learn Enough Git to Be Dangerous*, you'll know enough Git to be *dangerous*. This means you'll be able to use Git to track changes in your projects, back up data, share your work with others and collaborate with programmers and other users of Git.
